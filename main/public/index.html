                <p class="meal-descript-about">Idli is one of the most healthiest and popular South Indian breakfast dish. These are soft, light, fluffy steamed round cakes made with a ground, fermented rice and lentil batter. Here I share my foolproof recipe with video and step-by-step photos that will help you in making the best idli. This Idli recipe is one of the earliest recipe from the blog which has been tried and tested with great results by many of our readers. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="meal-instruct">
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <p>Rice Batter</p>
                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <p>In a bowl or pan take 1 cup parboiled rice and 1 cup regular rice. Here I have used the Indian variety of sona masuri rice along with parboiled rice.</p>
                <p>With Idli Rava: A second easier way is to use idli rava with urad dal. Idli rava is coarsely ground idli rice and is easily available in shops and online.
                    Soaking rice and lentils: For making simple traditional idli, both the rice and the urad dal are rinsed a couple of times with fresh water and soaked separately for 4 to 5 hours.
                    Quality of rice and urad dal: Make sure to use both rice and urad dal within their shelf-period. Always use urad dal which is fresh and within its shelf-life. Aged urad dal does not ferment well and makes the idli dense. 
                    Grinding: Then the lentils (urad dal) are ground to a soft, fluffy batter and the rice to a semi-fine consistency. Both the batters are mixed and allowed to ferment.
                    Grinding Equipments: The grinding of the batters, can be done in a table-top stone wet-grinder or in a mixer-grinder. Most South Indian families have a table top stone grinder that they trust to make a fluffy idli batter.
                    Table top stone grinder: Grinding in a stone grinder is helpful if making a large quantity of idli batter. The advantage of grinding in a stone grinder is that the urad dal batter gets ground really well and thus the idli batter ferments also well.
                    
                    The amount of water to be added in a stone-grinder is more than what is added in a mixer-grinder.
                    
                    For Â½ cup soaked urad dal, you can add about 1 cup water. Add water in parts while grinding urad dal. For 2 cups of soaked rice, add about 1.5 to 2 cups of water.
                    Mixer-grinder: The lentils also grind well in a mixer-grinder or heavy duty blender like Vitamix. For smaller quantities, a mixer-grinder or blender works like a charm.
                    
                    Everyone does not have a stone grinder. So I have shared the detailed method on how to grind the batter in a mixer-grinder with plenty of tips and suggestions in the step-by-step guide below.
                    
                    I have both a stone grinder and a mixer grinder. For smaller quantities, I use the mixie for grinding and for larger quantities I use the stone grinder.
                    Fermentation: Both the ground lentil batter and rice batter are mixed thoroughly. Then the batter is kept to ferment overnight or for 8 to 9 hours or more till the batter doubles or triples in volume having a pleasant sour aroma. The fermentation largely depends upon the temperature and climate. A warm temperature is conducive for a good fermentation in the batter.
                    Steaming: Special pans are used to steam the idli. You can buy these pans online. This idli pan is brushed or greased with some oil. The batter is poured in the pan and then steamed.
                    Steaming time: The steaming time varies from 12 to 15 minutes. Idli should never be oversteamed as then they become dry and dense.</p>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <p> Firstly, clean and wash the fish slices properly to ensure they are ready for cooking.</p>
                <p> Soak the tamarind in warm water and extract the juice, as this will add a tangy flavor to the curry.</p>
                    <p>  Grind the green chilies, cumin seeds, tomatoes, shallots, and curry leaves to create a smooth paste for the curry base.</p>
                        <p>  Heat a pan with oil over medium heat.</p>
                            <p> When the oil heats, add mustard seeds and fry until spluttering.</p>
                                <p> Then add fenugreek seeds and fry until browned.</p>
                                    <p>  Add garlic pods, chopped shallots, and curry leaves and sautÃ© until golden brown.</p>
                                        <p> Add red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and salt. SautÃ© well over low heat until a nice aroma comes.</p>
                                            <p> Add the ground tomato paste and sautÃ© well until the oil oozes out from the masala.</p>
                                                <p> Add water and tamarind extract and mix well. Cover and cook over low heat until it starts to boil.</p>
                                                    <p> Once boiled, add the fish slices and mango slices. Cover and cook for 10 to 15 minutes over low heat or until the fish pieces are cooked and the oil oozes out from the curry.</p>
                                                        <p>  Finally, add some fresh leaves and serve hot with white rice.</p>
